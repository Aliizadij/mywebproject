            <p>about me
                I am Ali Izadi. I have been in the UK since 2015. I am Iranian but my citizenship is Italian.
                I studied Microbiology even though I always worked as a journalist, indeed an article writer
                in politics field for Persian and Italian websites since 1990.
                Unfortunately I have never done any computer course since I decided to take part in Code-Nation
                present course, because I didnâ€™t need it as for my job I use a simple updated version of office
                and sometimes PDF format as well. 
                My aim for participating in the intensive software developer training provided by C-Nation is to
                improve my skills in this field. In addition learning programming language may affect my courier 
                as a journalist in different section apart the specific field I have been working.
