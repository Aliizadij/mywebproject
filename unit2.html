                Q 2.1 Review the ongoing use of IT tools and change approach as needed – in making your own website, are you
                happy with the tools you used? E.g. Visual Studio Code, Trello.
                <br>
                <p>
                The IT tools I used to make my own website was very useful. I am very happy for using Visual Studio Code and
                Trello because they helped me very much to do this job and some simples improvement on my website.
                Trello is indeed the best way to build a website because on top of it we can create a Power-Up. Once we have
                a Power-Up we can add a few buttons for new boards and cards on it.
                
                <p>
                Q 2.2 Describe whether the IT tools selected were appropriate E.g. Visual Studio Code, Trello.
                <br>
                <p>
                The chosen tools have been very appropriate specially Trello. Visual studio was very useful as it let me to
                use some key element and future such as possibility to perform folders and files.
                Visual Studio Code is very popular and powerful to use for text editing. As it contains an HTML document that.
                This give us a possibility to open it in the related web browser. In addition VSC by offering Syntax which is 
                a set of rules gives the ability how to create correctly written code.
                    
                <p>
                Q 2.3 Assess the strengths and weaknesses of your final project – are you happy with your website? Why? Why not?
                You should review it on the website itself in the interests of openness. What would you change?
                <br>
                <p>
                I am not too happy as I couldn’t use the right and powerful tools like Trello and Visual Studio Code very well,
                because I am new with these features. As I was trying just to run a simple project so I can say this is my plan’s
                strength but as I’ve just started it lack of any experiences to use IT tools in my project is indeed a big weakness.
                To solve this issue I have to work much more till I can improve my acknowledge.
                
                <p>
                Q 2.4 Describe further improvements you can make to your project.
                <br>
                I need to do a plenty of improvements which allow me to make my project more professional. The best way is focus
                on Visual Studio Code to improve my coding process. Then made Trello in an appropriate way, for this I should
                organize my project and break it down to the small chunks. 
                
                <p>
                Q 2.5 Review outcomes to make sure they match requirements and are fit for purpose.
                <br>
                My outcomes show I have to work much more on three key elements which lack of them caused suffering my system.
                The first is compatibility, the second is the integration and finally management and reporting capability. 
                These three factors are very fundamental to improve my project.
