            Q 1.1 Describing the purpose of IT in modern business
            <br>
            Information technology creates a huge innovation in business. It means we could do our job
            in smarts apps and very developed data storage in addition the advantage is faster processing
            and broader information distribution. This makes businesses to run more efficiently. The best 
            examples of this improvement are: Online selling and very quick and easy communication.
            </p>
            
            <p>
            Q 1.2 Describing methods, skills and resources needed to complete digital projects, what do
            you need to make projects successful? What tools? What skills?
            <br>
            There are a lot of developed feature to do this. Websites are basically one of the common instrument.
            Skills such as photo sharp and programming language as Python are very useful. Tolls such slack, 
            Trello and Kanban are very helpful to achieve the best results for our digital projects.
            </p>
            
            <p>
            Q 1.3 Plan and carry out tasks using IT – e.g. making your website. How will you plan it?
            Include a link to your Trello board. 
            <br>
            One of the best tools for this goal is Trello. It is indeed a software in Kanban style.
            In other word for Trello planning we should use Kanban. Trello is a collaborative tool that organizes
            every project into boards. Trello tells us about what is being worked on, members who working on and
            finally the place where something makes a process.
            </p>
            
            <p>
            Q 1.4 Describe the risks that might impact digital projects – what causes digital projects to fail? Why?
            <br>
            There are a plenty of reasons make digital projects fail. Sometimes a project becomes “ill-conceived”.
            Very often because there is not an adequate “buy-in” or lack of resources. It may happen as well when
            a vendor doesn't come through. We can say there is a complex of different risk factors, together
            to bring our projects or plans fail.
            </p>
            
            <p>
            Q 1.5 Describe how you would go about selecting and using IT systems and software- how do you select
            the right kind of technology- for the job? 
            <br>
            To do a job or project in a right way we first need break our plan down into small chunks becoming 
            easier to manage and to make it process. There are some tools such as Trello and Slack which are very
            useful for this aim. Trello give us a very accurate possibility to classify our project to make precisely,
            as it has different sections and boards like to-do, doing, done and a deadline for each step.
            One of Slack advantages is using shared channels and guest accounts for working directly with people who
            are not inside of the organization we worked. This is very important feature to keep each person who engaged
            in a project management to keep them always informed and up to date.
            </p>
            <p>
            Q 1.6 Describe and provide analysis on how your chosen technologies have helped you achieve your outcomes.
            – How has Trello helped you plan and how can git and GitHub help with your codes version control.
            <br>
            Trello helped me to keep track of the things I planned to do at my work. Trello boards helped me either an
            individual to-do or when I worked as a team to get organized. In addition by using Trello I became more 
            productive on my plan because I could keep track of the workload.
            Git helped me managing the code changes and any errors in the projects as Git makes codes easy to change and
            revert back to a specific version correctly in a easy way.
            GitHub as a code hosting platform it was very useful for me to take control of version and do collaboration.
            It was very helpful because let me and others in my team members working together on the project from anywhere.  
            </p>

            Q 1.7 Describe legal guidelines and constraints that impact digital projects –ts? How does GDPR impact
            digital project.
            <br>
            GDPR gives data subjects like online services users, a high degree of control via data processing. 
            It expands their goals and rights, because it gives them better insight into the quantity of information has
            been stored by users. This tells how information is used and let them to make a restriction and even a 
            completely stop in case.
            GDPR that stands for the General Data Protection Regulation has come into effect since 2018. Every individual
            has to work under 8 regulations of GDPR which definitely impact our projects so business.
